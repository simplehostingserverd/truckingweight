# AI Video Generation Guide

This guide provides instructions for creating an AI-generated video for the Trucking Weight Management System using Hugging Face models and other open-source tools.

## Option 1: Using Hugging Face Models

### Step 1: Generate AI Avatar
Use a text-to-image model to create a professional avatar:
- Model: [Stable Diffusion XL](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0)
- Prompt: "Professional business avatar, corporate spokesperson, high quality, photorealistic, business attire, neutral background, looking at camera, friendly expression"

### Step 2: Generate Voice
Use a text-to-speech model to create a natural-sounding voice:
- Model: [Bark](https://huggingface.co/spaces/suno/bark) or [MMS TTS](https://huggingface.co/facebook/mms-tts)
- Input: Use the script from `ai-video-script.md`
- Select a professional, clear voice

### Step 3: Generate Talking Head Video
Use a model that animates the avatar to match the speech:
- Model: [SadTalker](https://huggingface.co/spaces/vinthony/SadTalker) or [wav2lip](https://huggingface.co/spaces/cvssp/wav2lip)
- Input: Avatar image and generated audio

### Step 4: Add B-roll and Graphics
- Use stock footage of trucks, weigh stations, and logistics operations
- Create simple animated graphics to illustrate key points
- Add screenshots of the actual application interface

### Step 5: Edit and Finalize
- Combine all elements using a video editor
- Add background music and transitions
- Add captions for accessibility

## Option 2: Using D-ID or Similar Services

If you prefer a more streamlined approach, you can use services like:
- [D-ID](https://www.d-id.com/)
- [Synthesia](https://www.synthesia.io/)
- [HeyGen](https://www.heygen.com/)

These platforms provide end-to-end solutions where you can:
1. Select a pre-made avatar
2. Input your script
3. Generate a complete talking head video
4. Add custom backgrounds and graphics

## Option 3: Local Setup with Python

For a more customizable approach, you can set up a local environment:

```bash
# Clone repositories
git clone https://github.com/Winfredy/SadTalker.git
cd SadTalker
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Generate TTS using gTTS
pip install gTTS
python -c "from gtts import gTTS; tts = gTTS('Your script text here'); tts.save('output.mp3')"

# Run SadTalker
python inference.py --driven_audio output.mp3 --source_image avatar.jpg --result_dir ./results
```

## Recommended Workflow

1. Start with the script in `ai-video-script.md`
2. Generate the audio first to get the timing right
3. Create or select an avatar that represents your brand
4. Generate the talking head video
5. Enhance with B-roll, screenshots, and graphics
6. Add music and captions
7. Review and make adjustments as needed
