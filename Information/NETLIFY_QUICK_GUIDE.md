## Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Your Environment File

1. Copy the `.env.example` file from the `frontend` directory
2. Rename it to `.env.production`
3. Fill in all the required values:
   - Supabase URL and keys
   - License key
   - Security token
   - Authorized domains

### 2. Deploy to Netlify Using Drag and Drop

1. **Build the Application**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Prepare for Deployment**
   - Navigate to the `frontend/.next` directory
   - Create a ZIP file of the entire `.next` directory

3. **Deploy to Netlify**
   - Log in to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)
   - Go to the "Sites" section
   - Drag and drop the ZIP file onto the Netlify dashboard
   - Wait for the upload and processing to complete

4. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Go to "Site settings" > "Environment variables"
   - Click "Import from .env"
   - Upload your `.env.production` file
   - Alternatively, add each variable manually

5. **Set Up Custom Domain (Optional)**
   - Go to "Site settings" > "Domain management"
   - Click "Add custom domain"
   - Follow the instructions to set up your domain

### 3. Deploy to Netlify Using GitHub Integration

1. **Push Code to GitHub**
   - Ensure your code is pushed to the GitHub repository

2. **Connect to Netlify**
   - Log in to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Select GitHub as the Git provider
   - Authenticate with GitHub
   - Select the repository

3. **Configure Build Settings**
   - Base directory: `frontend`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `.next`
   - Click "Deploy site"

4. **Add Environment Variables**
   - Go to "Site settings" > "Environment variables"
   - Click "Import from .env"
   - Upload your `.env.production` file
   - Alternatively, add each variable manually

## Security Measures

### 1. License Verification

The application includes a license verification system that validates the deployment against our license server. If the license is invalid or expired, the application will not function correctly.

### 2. Kill Switch

The application includes a kill switch that can be activated remotely if unauthorized use is detected. This will disable the application and redirect users to an error page.

### 3. Code Obfuscation

All critical JavaScript files are obfuscated during the build process to make reverse engineering more difficult.

### 4. API Request Signing

All API requests include a signature generated using a secret key to prevent unauthorized API access.
