\i database/migrations/telematics_security_and_views.sql
```

### Step 3: Install Advanced Functions
```sql
-- Add safety scoring and alert functions:
\i database/migrations/telematics_functions.sql
```

### Step 4: Load Sample Data (Optional)
```sql
-- Load test data to verify installation:
\i database/sample_data/telematics_sample_data.sql
```

## ðŸ”’ Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Company-based data isolation
- User permission-based access
- Secure telematics provider data

### Data Protection
- Encrypted API keys and credentials
- Audit trails for all alerts
- Driver acknowledgment tracking

## ðŸ§ª Testing the Installation

### 1. Verify Tables Created
```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name LIKE '%telematics%' 
   OR table_name LIKE '%safety%' 
   OR table_name LIKE '%maintenance%';
```

### 2. Check Sample Data (if loaded)
```sql
-- Check telematics data
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vehicle_telematics_data;

-- Check safety alerts
SELECT severity, COUNT(*) 
FROM critical_safety_alerts 
GROUP BY severity;

-- Check dashboard status
SELECT status, COUNT(*) 
FROM dashboard_vehicle_status 
GROUP BY status;
```

### 3. Test Safety Scoring Function
```sql
-- Calculate safety score for a vehicle
SELECT * FROM calculate_vehicle_safety_score(
    (SELECT id FROM vehicles LIMIT 1)
);
```

### 4. View Real-time Dashboard
```sql
-- Check current vehicle status
SELECT * FROM current_vehicle_status LIMIT 5;

-- Check critical safety dashboard
SELECT * FROM critical_safety_dashboard;
```

## ðŸš¨ Critical Safety Features

### Accident Prevention Focus
The system specifically monitors the **top 5 mechanical issues** that cause truck accidents:

1. **Brake Failures** - #1 cause of accidents
2. **Lighting Failures** - #2 cause of accidents (brake lights, turn signals)
3. **Tire Problems** - Blowouts and pressure issues
4. **Engine Overheating** - Breakdown prevention
5. **Transmission Issues** - Mechanical failure prevention

### Real-time Monitoring
- **5-30 second data updates** from telematics devices
- **Immediate alerts** for critical safety issues
- **Predictive maintenance** to prevent failures
- **Driver notifications** with emergency contact options

## ðŸ“ž Support

If you encounter any issues during installation:

1. **Check Prerequisites**: Ensure all base tables exist
2. **Review Error Messages**: Most errors are related to missing dependencies
3. **Verify Permissions**: Ensure database user has CREATE privileges
4. **Test Incrementally**: Run each migration file separately

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

After successful installation:

1. **Configure Telematics Providers**: Add your 3rd party integrations
2. **Set Up Real-time Data Feeds**: Connect your telematics devices
3. **Configure Alert Thresholds**: Customize safety parameters
4. **Train Users**: Familiarize staff with the safety monitoring system
5. **Test Emergency Procedures**: Verify alert delivery and response

This comprehensive telematics system will significantly improve fleet safety by providing real-time monitoring of the mechanical issues that cause the most truck accidents, with immediate alerts to prevent accidents before they happen.
