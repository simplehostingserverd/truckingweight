  delete(path: string): Promise<boolean>;
  getMetrics(): Promise<StorageMetrics>;
}
```

### 2. Data Distribution Strategy
- **Hot Data** (0-30 days): NVMe primary storage
- **Warm Data** (30-365 days): NAS secondary storage  
- **Cold Data** (1+ years): Cloud archival storage
- **Backup Data**: Replicated across multiple systems

### 3. Load Balancing
- Round-robin distribution for writes
- Proximity-based routing for reads
- Automatic failover to backup systems
- Health monitoring and circuit breakers

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Data Compression
- **LZ4**: Fast compression for real-time data
- **ZSTD**: High compression ratio for archival
- **Automatic**: Based on data type and storage tier

### 2. Deduplication
- **Block-level**: For similar images/videos
- **File-level**: For duplicate documents
- **Cross-system**: Shared deduplication across storage

### 3. Caching Strategy
- **Redis**: Hot data caching (1-24 hours)
- **Local SSD**: Warm data caching (1-7 days)
- **CDN**: Static asset distribution

### 4. Parallel Processing
- **Multi-threaded uploads**: 4-16 concurrent streams
- **Chunked transfers**: 64MB chunks for large files
- **Pipeline processing**: Overlap compression/encryption

## Security Features

### 1. Encryption
